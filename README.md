# Coursera-Capstone
Repository for Coursera Capstone Project.

This repository contains files and code for the final module of the Data Science Specialization on Coursera. The specialization is conducted by John's Hopkins University, and the Capstone project is the final project in a series of modules on R programming and data science. More information can be found on the Coursera website [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience).

The capstone project consists of of formulating an interesting question from a dataset you want to answer, and using data science concepts to answer that question. The data set is provided by Yelp, an online platform where registered users can review businesses and share experiences. The dataset in question is downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/yelp_dataset_challenge_academic_dataset.zip). All code in this repository so long as the data set is unpacked in the current worksapce.
